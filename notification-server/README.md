## API subscribe documentation

The subscription endpoint is idempotent.

All account to device mapping being registered under a single endpoint call will have the same preferences

At most 1000 preferences and accounts can be registered in one call and only a 1000 accounts be queried at once.

Should conflicts occur upon subscription updates, then only the preferences becomes updates.

### Example:

```shell
‚ùØ curl -X PUT "http://localhost:3030/api/v1/device/example-device/subscription" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "preferences": ["CIS2", "CCDTransaction"],
        "accounts": ["6zLVntGxRRgFnwQf4HBZTwK2qWrg3"]
    }'
```
