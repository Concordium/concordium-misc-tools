## recover id object

A command-line tool that implements the identity recovery. It generates recovery
requests, contacts the identity provider, and recovers the identity objects.

## Build

To build run `cargo build --release`. This produces the binary `target/release/recover-id-object`.

## Run

See `--help` for the list of all the options. The tool has two modes: `generate-secrets` and `recover-identity`.

### Generate secrets

`generate-secrets` generates secrets for the recovery requests based on a seed phrase.
It outputs the secrets to standard output.

### Recover identity

`recover-identity` recovers the identity objects based on either a seed phrase or the secrets generated by `generate-secrets`.

To recover with a seed phrase, run:

```bash
recover-id-object --ip-index ... (* other args *) recover-identity --concordium-wallet <path-to-seed-phrase>
```

To recover with the secrets generated by `generate-secrets`, run:

```bash
recover-id-object --ip-index ... (* other args *) recover-identity --prf-key <PRF_KEY> --id-cred-sec <ID_CRED_SEC> --id-index <ID_INDEX>
```
